# Front-End-Milestone-Project

This is the first of 3 Milestone projects as a part of the North Carolina State Software Development Bootcamp program. The objectives of the project are to create a functional
browser game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I chose to make a trivia game, with inspiration taken from Jeopardy.
