Front-End-Milestone-Project-Trivia-Game

This is the first of 3 Milestone projects as a part of the North Carolina State Software Development Bootcamp program. The objectives of the project are to create a functional
browser game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I chose to make a trivia game, with inspiration taken from several game shows of the same variaty.

In order to play the game you simply have to click on whichever answer choice you believe to be correct, the game will automatically move forward and keep score as you 
answer the questions. Once you answer all the questions the game will automatically display your total score. Furthermore, once the player clicks the "end game" button
regardless if they have answered every question or not, a sound will play depending on the players score (50% correct or less than 50% correct). I would like to in the future create 
a button that allows the player to go backwards in the quiz, as well as randomize the questions given.
